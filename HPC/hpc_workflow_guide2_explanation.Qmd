Great questions! Let me help you set up MATLAB and R kernels in JupyterLab, and then configure VSCodium for a more stable remote connection.Perfect! I've updated the guide with comprehensive sections on:

## **Key Additions:**

### **1. MATLAB in JupyterLab**
Three options:
- **jupyter-matlab-proxy** (easiest): Gives you MATLAB interface in browser
- **MATLAB Engine API**: For programmatic access
- **imatlab kernel**: Full MATLAB kernel (if you have permissions)

### **2. R in JupyterLab**
Very straightforward:
```bash
mamba activate jupyter
mamba install r-irkernel r-essentials
# Done! R kernel appears in Jupyter
```

### **3. RStudio Server**
I included a SLURM launch script similar to JupyterLab, or you can check if your HPC has Open OnDemand (web portal with RStudio built-in).

### **4. VSCodium Setup (Recommended!)**
This solves your disconnection problem:
- **More stable** than browser-based Jupyter
- **Auto-reconnects** if network hiccups
- **No SSH tunnel needed** - direct connection
- **Full IDE features** - debugging, git, etc.
- **Can still use notebooks** - opens `.ipynb` files natively

### **5. Preventing Disconnections**
Three key strategies:
- **tmux** on HPC (work survives disconnects)
- **Better SSH config** (keepalive settings)
- **Connection multiplexing** (faster reconnects)

## **My Recommended Setup:**

1. **Primary: VSCodium with Remote-SSH**
   - Most stable for daily work
   - Works with Python, R, MATLAB, Julia
   - Opens notebooks directly

2. **Secondary: JupyterLab**
   - For presentation/sharing notebooks
   - When you specifically need Jupyter widgets

3. **Always: tmux**
   - Run on HPC: `tmux new -s work`
   - If disconnected: `tmux attach -s work`
   - Everything preserved!

## **Quick Start:**

```bash
# Setup R kernel
mamba activate jupyter
mamba install r-irkernel r-essentials

# Setup MATLAB (if available)
pip install jupyter-matlab-proxy

# Test
jupyter kernelspec list

# Install VSCodium on your laptop
# Connect via Remote-SSH to HPC
# Start tmux session
# Work without worrying about disconnects!
```

Would you like me to help you with any specific part, like configuring MATLAB or setting up your first VSCodium connection?
