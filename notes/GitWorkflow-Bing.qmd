Great question! Both approaches you’re weighing are legitimate and widely used—it really comes down to workflow preferences, team dynamics, and deployment needs. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide, along with the essential Git commands for each.

---

## 🧭 Option 1: **Develop on `main`, deploy from a separate branch**  
### 🛠️ Description  
You do all work directly on the `main` branch and then push it or merge it into a special deployment branch (e.g., `production`, `gh-pages`, etc.), which is used for deploying the final product.

### ✅ Pros  
- Simple mental model—only one active development branch.
- Minimizes chances of merge conflicts.
- Useful for static sites or auto-deployed docs (e.g., GitHub Pages pulling from `gh-pages`).
- Easy to trigger deployment workflows from the deployment branch.

### ❌ Cons  
- Riskier: any bugs or unstable code added to `main` may slip into production.
- No space for long-term experiments or testing unless using local branches.
- Limited flexibility for collaborative or parallel development.

### 💻 Workflow + Git Commands  
```bash
# Make changes on main
git checkout main
# Edit files
git add .
git commit -m "Work in progress"

# When ready to deploy, push to deployment branch
git checkout production
git merge main
git push origin production
```

## 🧪 Option 2: **Develop in feature branches, merge into `main` for production**  
### 🛠️ Description  
Each new feature or fix gets its own branch off `main`. When it’s complete and tested, it's merged back into `main`, which represents the deployable product.

### ✅ Pros  
- Cleaner, safer dev lifecycle—main stays stable.
- Better for collaboration and code reviews (e.g., via pull requests).
- Easier to roll back or isolate bugs.
- Scales well with teams and CI/CD pipelines.

### ❌ Cons  
- Slightly more overhead in terms of branch management.
- Need clear policies for merging and rebasing.
- Requires discipline to keep `main` deploy-ready.

### 💻 Workflow + Git Commands  
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-awesome-thing

# Work on your feature
# Edit files
git add .
git commit -m "Add new awesome thing"

# Merge back into main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/new-awesome-thing
git push origin main
```

## 🧩 Which One Should You Use?

If you:
- ✅ **Work solo** and want **simplicity** → Option 1 may feel smoother.
- ✅ Need **multiple people**, **testing stages**, or **stable deployment triggers** → Option 2 gives you more control and scalability.

Would you like help setting up a `.gitignore`, a CI/CD workflow, or even some branching strategy naming conventions? Let’s level up your dev game. 💪
